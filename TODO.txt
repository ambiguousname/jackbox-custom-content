- Build main menu UI: https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/book/composite_templates.html
- Automate ContentCol.rs to handle creation, find one place to be able to define the columns.
- Is there a way to replace clone! macros with something better?
- Create Option<> for some windows to avoid multiple constructions (like JCCPreferences. Check the constructor.)

Planned Features:
- Mod List for easy export/import
- Support for all the games again (minus Everyday)
- Better UI design
- Safer file handling
